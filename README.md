# Fashion outfit decision tool or The Outfit Oracle

### How it works:

- clothing items are randomly generated, eg. 10 items or more
- either TWO or THREE items are paired/grouped together
- then there are several rules for how theses items can be combined based on: their type ('upper garment', 'lower garment'), their fit ('loose', 'fitted'), their colour ('red', 'blue', 'yellow', 'orange', 'green', 'purple', 'white', 'black')
- so only compatible items will be grouped together

# 
#### Rules:

Type: 
- each pair or group of items need to have at least one of each type ('upper garment', 'lower garment')
- but not all of the same type so that each group creates an actual outfit
- but can be two upper garments and one lower or vice versa

Fit:
- each pair or group of items need to have at least one of each fit ('loose', 'fitted')
- but not all of the same fit
- for the group of three items, there cant be two items of the same type and fit and only the third item different

colour:
- primary colours can only be combined with primary colours
- secondary and neutral colours (like on a classic colour wheel) can be combined amongst themseleves

# 

Based on these rules the items will be paired or grouped together.


These items are supposed to represent a range of clothing items, so a loose, upper garment could be a jumper; or a tight, lower garment could be a pair of trousers, etc.
