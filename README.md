# building a fashion closet decision tool based on some rules

### lets call it outfit oracle


there should be a randomly generated closet  to test it and then also the option to input your own items

So a class with different allowed values for different attributes

Then first try with the randomly generated instances
Have your own instance of your closet in a separate file

Then filter and categorise based on attributes so they follow the rules to group them into pairs or groups so you create outfits
